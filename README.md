## NBA-Spread-and-Total-Predictor

### The goal of this project was very simple: To create a predictive model that could predict spreads (winning margin) and totals (combined score of the two teams) for a list of ~150 NBA games during the 2024/25 season. This project saw me experiment with numerous techniques, including XGBoost, lasso, and linear models. I also created a couple new variables to go into those models, one of which was AvgTSMins. This is the average true shooting percentage for each player on a team but every player's value is weighted by how many minutes they played the game before. Similar to the Premier League predictive model I made, this one also utilized many cumulative means of the various input variables to aid in the predictions. Additionally, this model only used past data during testing to replicate real conditions when testing for predictive strength. Ultimately, the models performed decently well and I was able to profit ~$50 from following the advice of it for betting on both spreads and totals.
